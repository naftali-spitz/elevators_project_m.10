Elevator Project
===============

Introduction
------------

This is a simulation of an elevator system, where users can interact with the elevators and floors to simulate real-world elevator behavior.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Install Python and Pygame on your system.
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Run the `RunGame.py` file to start the game.

Gameplay
--------

The game allows users to interact with the elevators and floors using the mouse. Clicking on a floor button will call an elevator to that floor. The elevators will move between floors based on the user's input.

Features
--------

* Simulation of an elevator system with multiple floors and elevators
* User interaction with floor buttons to call elevators
* Elevators move between floors based on user input
* Real-time display of elevator positions and floor numbers

Dependencies
------------

* Python 3.x
* Pygame 2.x
